Trinity is located in San Antonio and is surrounded by wonderful restaurants and tons of awesome places to explore. Trinity's campus promotes an environment filled with love and acceptance, with all of the clubs and sports Trinity offers there is something for everyone.

Overall Trinity is a great institution that provides a top tier education while giving the students the opportunity to make connections with the faculty and student body.

<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are definitely the Bell Center and sports facilities. As a football player it definitely is awesome to have such a nice place to workout and get better, there is something about a nice weight room that makes you wanna work harder. It's also pretty cool to witness all of the improvements they are making to the football field and trying to make our athletics top tier. </p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because it gave me the opportunity to get an amazing education with individualized learning, making you feel like the professors actually care about you. I also chose Trinity because it allowed me to continue my football career with a great football team and learn under a great coaching staff.</p>
<p>I am thinking of majoring in Business administration because I think that I could have a promising career in the business field and I would enjoy getting to go to work everyday with a job in sales or marketing . Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
